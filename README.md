# 👋 Hi, I’m Manoj Gadamsetty

iOS developer | Swift enthusiast | Advocate for secure, user-friendly mobile apps

## About Me

🛠️ I craft robust iOS apps with **Swift**, focusing on **clipboard management** and **mobile security**[2].  
🔐 Big believer that privacy isn’t just a feature—it's the foundation.  
🧠 Sometimes I build **custom APIs** (and yes, I self-host my own time servers because precision matters)[3].

## What I Do

- Build iOS applications that keep your data safe (and your clipboard secrets private)
- Integrate security best practices to stay one step ahead of troublemakers
- Tinker with clever back-end and API solutions so everything just works

## Skills

| Mobile Development      | Security & Privacy      | Back-End & APIs         |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Swift, Objective-C     | Secure Coding          | Golang                  |
| Android (Java, Kotlin) | Encryption, OWASP      | Self-hosted Time Server |
| Xcode, Android Studio  | Pen Testing            | API Design              |

## A Few Fun Facts

- My clipboard manager is probably safer than your bank account[2]
- I prefer my APIs home-brewed (self-hosted time servers for the win!)[3]
- Coffee, code, and creative bug squashing—my daily routine
